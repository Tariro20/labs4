                <h1> The Making of the Gallery</h1>
                <p>Hello! My name is Tariro and welcome to my gallery! This is my first context page so please enjoy.
                This is the first time I have ever coded and so far its been pretty fun. This year is also the same year I
                changed my major to UX Design. I'm really taking a leap of faith and stepping out of my comfort zone. But I'm trying
                to stay positive!</p>
                <h2> 2025!</h2>
                <p>
                So far it's been a journey but that's okay. I've stepped out of my comfort zone a few times already. I've also made
                a few changes in my life, which have really benfitted me. This is the year of focus and understanding not everything is 
                gonna go my way. It's good to learn how to handle situations like that. This is also the year I turn 20 and i'll no longer 
                be a teenager. It's good to take the time to mature to become the person you want to be. Which are key things i'm working on
                </p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>It's possible to change things for yourself, as long as you're willing to put in the work</li>
                    <li>Never get defensive when someone has an issue they want to talk to you about</li>
                    <li>It's always better to communicate something rather than ignoring the problem</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Future</h3>
                <p>I have a lot of goals for my future and I hope that some of them, will come true. I live in a family with succesful people 
                    and I also want to live the same lives they do as well. There's so much more to live then just working, and it would be a 
                prilivege for me to explore the world later in life. Here are some place I would love to visit!
